ENABLING AND DISABLING RELATIVE NUMBERING
    The Relative Numbering plugin provides a command: >
	:RltvNmbr[!]
<   The :RltvNmbr command enables relative numbering.
    The :RltvNmbr! command disables relative numbering.

    If :RN hasn't been previously defined, then one may also use >
	:RN
<   to toggle relative numbering.

    The RltvNumbr plugin reports on its enabled/disabled status with >
    	b:rltvnmbrmode=1 : RltvNmbr mode is enabled
    	b:rltvnmbrmode=0 : RltvNmbr mode is disabled
<    This variable is used for reporting and to control :RN based toggling.

YOU MUST HAVE SIGNS FOR THIS PLUGIN
    To use this plugin your vim must have been compiled with the "huge" feature
    set (so as to have +signs in the :version listing).  Typically that means
    having used >
	configure --with-features=huge
<
    To determine if your copy of vim has signs, you may: >
    	:echo has("signs")
<   If it shows "1", then your vim supports signs.

    Alternatively, you may: >
	:version
<   and if +signs appears in the listing, then, again, your vim supports
    signs.  If it lists -signs, then unfortunately your vim does not do so.

MODFIYING THE RELATIVE NUMBERING HIGHLIGHTING
    The relative numbering signs are highlighted with >

	hi default HL_RltvNmbr_Minus    gui=none,italic ctermfg=red   ctermbg=black guifg=red   guibg=black
	hi default HL_RltvNmbr_Positive	gui=none,italic ctermfg=green ctermbg=black guifg=green guibg=black

<   This information is provided so that you may know what to specify to use
    your preferences in relative number highlighting.  One way to get your
    preferred colorization in is to put lines like the following into
    .vim/after/plugin/RltvNmbr.vim: >

	au FileType * hi HL_RltvNmbr_Minus    gui=none ctermfg=yellow  ctermbg=black guifg=yellow  guibg=black
	au FileType * hi HL_RltvNmbr_Positive gui=none ctermfg=magenta ctermbg=black guifg=magenta guibg=black
<

HOW TO START WITH RELATIVE NUMBERING MODE ENABLED
   Using >
   	Unix: ~/.vim/after/plugin/RltvNmbr.vim
	Windows: $HOME\_vimfiles\after\plugin\RltvNmbr.vim
<  place the following line: >
	call RltvNmbr#RltvNmbrCtrl(1)

THE RELATIVE NUMBERING PATCH
    This plugin was inspired by the relative-numbering patch mentioned on the
    vim-dev mailing list, written by Markus Heidelberg.  You can find his patch at

http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/attach/10fa0944a8b643b4/vim-7.2-relativenumber-02.patch?part=2

    This plugin uses signs to enable relative numbering.  Signs are assigned
    on a buffer-by-buffer basis as an inherent limitation, so a given buffer
    can only display one set of signs.  The relative numbering patch does not
    have this limitation.  To see this effect, try using >
    	vim -O file file
<   and use relative numbering provided by this plugin.  You'll find that the
    relative numbering column will change as you switch windows to reflect
    your active cursor.
